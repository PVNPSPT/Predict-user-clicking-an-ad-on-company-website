# Predict whether a user clicks an advertisement on a company website
## Project Description
The project is about predicting whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. A Machine Learning model is built to predict whether or not a user will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

## Technologies used
1. Python (NumPy, Pandas)
2. Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3. Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Metrics)

## Project Tasks
### 1. Get the data
Imported and loaded the data into a **Pandas DataFrame**. The dataset has features like <code>Daily Time Spent on Site, Age, Area Income, Daily Internet Usage, Ad Topic Line, City, Male, Country, Timestamp, Clicked on Ad.</code> Observed the different statistical information by **Descriptive Statistical methods**.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed the features of the dataset by plotting them uisng **Seaborn**. Examined the relationship between features with the help of different kinds of plots like 
**pairplot**, **jointplot**, **histogram**.
### 3. Build a Machine Learning model




Performed **Feature Selection** with the help of the analysis from the plots. Built Machine Learning model using **Logistic Regression**. Evaluated the model by creating the classification report and achieved an accuracy of **91%**. Pretty good!
